Sorry about the code it's a bit messy, ot much time was put into it, about 2-4 hours a day.
I spent more time on visual board representation than on algorithm. I named it algorithm v0.1 
because it's my first idea and it's the simplest one.
Maximum number of columns is 18278 because there is only 3 places for letters and maximum rows is 999, for the same reason.
There are no tests yet because I'm short on time.
